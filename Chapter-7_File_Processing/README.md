## Key Differences:
### Without flush: 
There's a risk that data remains in the buffer and is not written to the file if the buffer isn't full or if the program terminates before closing the writer.
### With flush: 
The flush method forces the buffer to write all its contents to the file, ensuring that all data is written immediately.

Using flush guarantees that all data written to the BufferedWriter is actually written to the file, reducing the risk of data loss due to buffering.
